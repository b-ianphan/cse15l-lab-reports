* To install VSCode, I simply went to the internet, searched up "VSC download", and then downloaded the version that was compatable with my operating system and specs.

* I then made a file called `helloWorld.java` and made sure my IDE worked as I wanted.

* To connect to a remote computer, I used the linux command `ssh` (secure socket shell) followed by my school given ID (cs12lspr22ask@ieng6.ucsd.edu).

* I then entered my password when prompted to (a password must be entered everytime you want to remotely connect unless you set up a `ssh key`).

* In the provided picture, you may see me experimenting with some different linux commands.
